# CMD-O-Mancer
A commandline client for betting on DEX prediction games (ie. PancakeSwap, CandleGenie)

## USAGE
On start will CMD-O-Mancer automatically find the BSC RPC with the lowest latency, for high efficiency and close to lock betting.

Once loaded in, you will see an overview of the settings.

You will be asked which side and what amount you want to bet on the current round, once bet txn has been sent, you will be showed if the txn was successful or if it was reverted.

If you skipped one round and find that the program is displaying the wrong round number, simply hit enter to grab the new and current round.
